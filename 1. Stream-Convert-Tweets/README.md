# Data Processing and Python (with ArcGIS)

The first part of the practicals in the Advancing Programming module covered data processing and Python, specifically with ArcGIS. The following areas were covered: Scripts, Addins, GUI/Display, SQLite, and XML.

For further information about each area, please read the README provided in each subfolder.

Summary of each folder/item:

* ArcPy-Addin-GUI: contains an Add-In script used to open the Models.tbx and run the script created during the Arcpy-Scripts practical. It also contains a TraffordScript.py file which produces a new layer file containing information about buildings at risk of being burgled.
* Databases-SQLite: contains two files; one which creates a database using information from the "GUI-Display" new layer output, and a database that reads the newly created database.
* XML: contains a script which validates the schema of an XML file, then edits the file to transform it into HTML.
