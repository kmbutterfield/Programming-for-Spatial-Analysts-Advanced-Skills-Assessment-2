### CreateTimeSeries.py
<b>Requires Pandas and Vincent</b>

Using Vincent, a time-series area chart is created based on the CSV Tweet data's "created_at" column. As shown below, the output is not very visually effective due to the constant abundance of tweets.

Tweets during the live Royal wedding streamed in consantaly at around 2,700 Tweets per minute. This is not surpring as it is such a large event. To improve this code, an alternative graphing method could be utilised with a larger y-axis miniumum value.

### CommonTimeZones.py
<b>Requires Pandas </b>

Using Pandas in Jupyter Notebooks, you can create a table of the top 15 most common time zones from the Tweet data.

This script is simple yet useful, providing you an idea of where Tweeters are from using their bio location. As you can see, most Tweets on the Royal wedding came from those in the US and Canada, and the UK. Despite the time difference, users around the world tuned in and watched the wedding, or Tweeted about it. 

## MapTweets.py
<b>Requires Pandas and Folium </b>
