# Data Analysis and Python
The second part of the practicals in the Advancing Programming module covered data analysis using Python, specifically Natural Language Processing, Pandas, and Bokeh.

## The Pandas-Bokeh subfolder contains two IPython Notebooks:
* The PandasExercise.ipynb notebook contains code provided SWCarpentry at: http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/ following steps 7, 8, and 9.
* The BokehExercise.ipynb notebook contains code provided by Bokeh's website: https://bokeh.pydata.org/ following their "Quickstart" tutorial and their "Mapping Geo Data" tutorial.

## The NLTK subfolder contains two key files:
* NLP-Example.py
* NLP-Bokeh.ipynb

In order for the NLP-Bokeh.ipynb file to run, the NLP-Example.py file must be ran first to produce an output file named "places-locations.csv". For further information on these two files, read the README within the NLTK subfolder.
